When you lower the screen to less than 550px, certain elements create scrollbars. The whole page has one at the bottom, for text that goes off screen, and there are scrollbars that appear on text boxes that display sample code that stretch out further than 550px. 
THis happens because there is a container around the central column of the page. This container is set to a max-width of 800px and min width of 550px. This means that as the browser is increased, the contents of the container won't stretch further than 800px across, and if the screen is condensed below 550px, a scrollbar will appear as the contents will still take up the space as though they were 550px wide.
